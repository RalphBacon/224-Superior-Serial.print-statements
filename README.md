Watch the video first to bring yourself up to speed!





### There are two examples for you: 
* the first is the one used in the YouTube video; it's simple and very understandable and will save you program (sketch) space and speed up final execution of the code too.

* the second is more advanced and was not covered in the video. It prints out the function and line number from where the debugging statement was called, and is more granular: you can different levels of debugging message, including Errors, Warnings, General Debugging and Verbose messages. You can easily expand on these types.

If you are new to this, install the first example first (or ensure you understand the concepts) before installing the more advanced method.
